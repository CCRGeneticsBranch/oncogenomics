## Oncogenomics protal

Welcome to the tutorial of Oncogenomics. Oncogenomics is a web-based portal for displaying cancer analysis results such as SNPs calling, copy number analysis, gene fusion and RNAseq expression. Oncogenomics is developed by Dr. Javed Khan's lab at NCI. This portal can visualize results directly from the NGS pipeline: https://github.com/CCRGeneticsBranch/ngs_pipeline-v3.2.2. 
The mission of the Oncogenomics Section is to harness the power of high throughput genomic and proteomic methods to improve the outcome of children with high-risk metastatic, refractory and recurrent cancers. The research goals are to integrate the data, decipher the biology of these cancers and to identify and validate biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets and to rapidly translate our findings to the clinic. For more information about our research, visit the Oncogenomics Section website.

Oncogenomics has two versions: NIH internal site(available on NIH network): https://oncogenomics.ccr.cancer.gov/ Public site: https://clinomics.ccr.cancer.gov/
