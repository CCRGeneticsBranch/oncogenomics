# Patients

In Oncogenomics, patients could be clinical subjects or research cell lines. One patient might consist of multiple cases which represent different tumor samples or research experiments. The patient pages allow users to track all cases in single interface.

This is an example of a cell line TT. On the top section, it provides the basic information about this patient/cell line.

* Project list. One patient might belong to multiple projects. Here we displayed a granted project list. In this example, the cell line TT belongs to "All Cell Lines", "MTC" and "MTC\__Vandetani_b\_resistance". The current project in the page is "MTC\__Vandetani_b\_resistance".
* Diagnosis. The diagnosis of this patient/cell line. In this example, it is Medullary thyroid carcinoma.
* Patient ID. The ID of patient of cell line.

Please note different projects might contain different cases for the same patient. If you cannot see the cases of interested, you should check if the project selected is correct. You can always switch project by clicking the "Switch Projects" drop-down menu.

If a patient has multiple cases, a "merged" at the end provides a combined information for all the cases.
